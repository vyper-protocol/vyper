# Overview

Vyper is a protocol to create, trade and settle on-chain **permissionless derivatives**.

Vyper's innovative approach creates a common infrastructure for on-chain derivatives, increasing scalability and greatly reducing costs.

Vyper is unique in bringing scalability and modularity to DeFi derivatives, replicating many of the existing features of TradFi for a fraction of the cost.

Vyper is built with **composability** at its core, enabling application layers to be built on top of a common infrastructure.

## Vyper Core

Vyper Core is the core engine for the machine.

Vyper Core is

- a [Solana](https://solana.com/) program
- written in rust
- developed by the Vyper Core team and [some other fellows](misc/contributors.md)
- built with [Anchor framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) and some [other libraries](misc/libraries.md)
- completely [open source](https://github.com/vyper-protocol/vyper-core)

## Why Solana

Vyper is a Solana-native protocol. The core team choose Solana mainly for the DeFi friendly ecosystem and for great developer experience the environment can offer.

As of now the core team has not made any statements regarding the willingness to go cross- chain, but in the future this is something technically possible.
